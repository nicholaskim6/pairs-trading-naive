# Naive Pairs Trading
A first attempt at investigating applications of machine learning to longer term pairs trading strategies. Used clustering techniques to efficiently find cointegrated stocks and applied ML classifiers to optimize for profitable position entry/exit. Found little profitability - currently acknowledge that this is a fairly naive approach to pairs trading, mainly 
owing to its timescale (multiday) and rough approach to finding cointegrated pairs (much simpler on say, different maturities for the same future). Looking to soon do a better version on intraday relationships and significantly shorter timescales with tick data soon.
