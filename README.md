# Naive Pairs Trading
## (COS424, Spring 2019)
Investigated applications of machine learning to longer term pairs trading strategies. Used clustering techniques to efficiently find
cointegrated stocks and applied ML classifiers to optimize for profitable position entry/exit. Found little profitability - currently acknowledge that this is a fairly naive approach to pairs trading. Looking to soon do a better version on intraday relationships and significantly shorter timescales with tick data.
